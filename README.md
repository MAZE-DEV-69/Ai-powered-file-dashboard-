This is your own voice-controlled dashboard for personal data—productivity stats, focus hours, tasks, health—you name it.
It runs completely offline, pulls from local JSON files, and responds to natural voice commands.

No servers. No APIs. No surveillance. Just your data, your rules. ( like you are the ceo ) lol

What You Can Do
Talk to it: Click a button, speak a command like “show productivity”
See instant data: It’ll pull the matching local JSON and update the UI
Run it anywhere: Browser or Electron—no backend needed
Easily add data: Drop in a JSON file and it’s live
